    text: Before importing the package, make sure to backup the project and your
      Input Manager for safety. Be aware that the Input Manager will be overridden.
      In order to back up your Input Manager settings, make sure to create a copy
      of "InputManager.asset" inside the ProjectSettings folder. You can replace
      the "InputManager.asset" file with your copy once the package is installed
      to restore your input settings.
